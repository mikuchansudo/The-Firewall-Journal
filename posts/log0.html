        <h1>Log0 - The Hacker’s Mindset</h1>
        <p>Hacking is often misunderstood. People picture someone in a dark room, typing away to break into a system—but that’s a shallow interpretation. True hacking isn’t just about breaching security; it’s about understanding systems at their deepest level and questioning why they exist the way they do. A hacker doesn’t just look at a firewall and think about how to bypass it. They ask: *Why was this built? What assumptions went into its design? Where does trust break down?* Every system, whether digital, social, or even psychological, operates on a set of rules, and those rules aren’t sacred—they’re just constructs waiting to be tested. Hacking is about perception, creativity, and adaptation. Where most see a lock and accept its security, a hacker wonders how many ways it can be bypassed—not just technically, but socially and psychologically. It’s about thinking beyond convention and questioning the limitations imposed by others.  
More than ever, hacking is evolving beyond the simplistic divide of "good" and "bad." It’s not just about black hats and white hats, legality or illegality—it’s about seeing the world differently. Security is built by following rules, but progress comes from those who challenge them. Every exploit, every workaround, every loophole starts with a single question no one else thought to ask. The digital world constantly shifts, but hackers don’t fear change; they embrace it. Whether breaking into a network or breaking out of outdated ways of thinking, the hacker’s mindset is about freedom, knowledge, and never accepting things at face value. The real question isn’t How do I hack this? It’s What am I truly capable of?	</p>
