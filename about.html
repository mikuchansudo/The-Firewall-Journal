                Kevin Mitnick was more than just a hackerâ€”he was a legend in the cybersecurity world. 
                Once the most wanted cybercriminal in the United States, he later transformed into 
                a leading security consultant, author, and educator. His journey from the underground 
                to the forefront of ethical hacking inspired an entire generation of security 
                professionals to think beyond the limits and question the status quo.

                Mitnick's life was a testament to curiosity, adaptability, and relentless problem-solving. 
                His work continues to shape the field of cybersecurity, reminding us that hacking is 
                not just about breaking into systems, but about understanding them deeply. 
                This journal pays homage to his legacy and the hacker spirit he embodied.
